# WebGPU - High Poly Mesh Visualiser

This repository contains an experimental project developed using WebGPU, the next-generation web graphics API.
It focuses on rendering high polygon meshes efficiently in the browser. The goal of this project is to explore
WebGPU's performance when handling user uploaded meshes and textures.

## Features
- Renders high-poly 3D meshes using WebGPU
- Demonstrates efficient pipeline setup and rendering loop
- Highlights WebGPU concepts such as adapters, devices, pipelines and bind groups

## Prerequisites
- A browser capable of supporting WebGPU, e.g., latest chrome, edge or safari version
- Node.js and npm as this project was built using Webpack

## Getting Started

- Clone the repository
- Navigate to repository folder
- Install dependencies using npm install
- Run the project using "npm start"
